### Github page move

Hello everyone. I've like many technical people, I want to write a blog about the interesting stuff I run into at work. Sometimes just
to get the ideas out, sometimes because I'd like to believe the blog entries would help someone. One of the many reasons I don't blog
as much as I feel I should is the types (WYSIWYG) and quality of the blogging software available.  I'd tried [blogspot](https://gsamuelhays.blogspot.com) and [wordpress](https://gsamuelhays.wordpress.com)
but just wasn't feeling the interfaces.  There was a brief moment were I'd thought about rolling my own infrastructure using S3, DynamoDB, and Lambda but
thought "fuck it, too much work" and not to mention that is not the kind of work I am at all interested in. So - things had to wait.

Anyway, recently I ran into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and though, "Yep... this is it". And so here I am.  Of course, I mentioned the technical problems 
were the _primary_ problem. The secondary problem was my laziness - though I would like to believe that was just annoyance w/ the platform. Time will tell.

Anyway. Hopefully I can stick w/ this and write some interesting stuff.
