On June 2nd 2018, my good friend Wayne Yourison passed away - just five days shy of his 50th birthday.

He wouldn't have wanted a maudlin display of sadness, so I'd like to remember my friend here.

I first met Wayne around 2001 or perhaps 2002 when I was the systems administrator at Patio Enclosures in Ohio. Wayne was in some other department in some other business unit, I can't remember, but he wanted to get into IT.  Marie, and woman in HR, asked me to get together and chat with Wayne about his goals and to see if I could be of any help.  Typically, I am not a big fan of these kinds of situations but I respected Marie and went along with it. I owe her one.

Wayne and I ended up heading out to Pizza Hut over lunch to chat about what he wanted to do with his life. That conversation is something like 17 years ago now, and my recollection isn't perfect but I remember he was a hobbyist programmer and wanted to get to be more involved in Programming and IT in general.  I wasn't able to help then.  However, a relatively short time later, a helpdesk position opened up and I urged my boss to consider him even though he was light on professional experience. He did and Wayne got the job.

Over the next few years, Wayne and I became better friends. I wouldn't say we were the best of friends, but certainly enough that we ate lunch together fairly regularly and played some video games (like Starcraft or Diablo) together. One of the things that always struck me was his willingness to help no matter what the job, or when. I used to joke with my friend Paul that if I had ever had to bury a body, Wayne would be my guy.  Paul, at first was a little defensive: "What? Why wouldn't you call me?" (as Paul and I were argueably better friends), but I explained - Wayne was the kind of guy who would show up, and get the job done whereas Paul and I would sit around arguing over the optimal body-burying technique until the police arrived. We laughed and shared the story with Wayne who I believe took a little pride in the outcome of my conclusion - joke or not. To be sure, the underlying truth was not a joke. Wayne was a "do anything for anyone" kind of guy. A friend who could be counted on utterly.

There was one day that Wayne and I had planned on getting together one evening, ordering some pizza, and playing Diablo for a few hours. Role playing games like that were his second favorite - second only to D&D - which I had not been allowed to play as a kid and so didn't play as an adult. Well, I came home and fell asleep on the couch - sleeping through the time we'd agreed to. Wayne showed up and saw me snoozing through the front-door Window and instead of being angry or waking me up (which I later said is what he should have done), he brought my empty garbage can back from the road (day before had been 'garbage day') and straighened up some stuff around the porch of my house and then quietly went home.

Some 45 minutes later I awoke and realized I had missed him. I did not, however, miss what he had done and I called him up, apologized profusely and invited him back over - Pizza on me. We ended up having a good time and I have never forgotten the kindness showed to me then. When he could have been justifiably angry, he didn't pound on the door and wake me up, he didn't call me. He saw a chore he could do, did it, and then left. 

Over the years afterward I ended up getting married whereas Wayne stayed single. This, of course, reduced the time we could spend together but he did come over and play video games with me and the kids from time to time and I went to his house to hang out sometimes too. Its the way things go, I guess, and I wouldn't change the choices of my life, but nevertheless I am sad we didn't spend more time together. Eventually, I took a job in Los Angeles, California and moved across the country where Wayne and I all but lost touch.  

Neither Wayne nor I are 'keep in touch' kind of people when great distance is involved but we chatted occassionally. Then, again, I moved - but this time to Colorado (where I am now). In 2016 I reached out again to suggest that he visit. We hadn't seen each other in a long time and I had heard he had had some heart trouble (to put it mildy - to put a finer point on it: He had had a quadruple bypass). So, arrangements were made and Wayne spent time with me and my family. We took a stroll through the Garden of the Gods, ate at some restaurants, played some games - caught up. On the second day of his visit, I was trying to hang a large painting over my fireplace and, being the guy he was, insisted that he do it. He did not want me or any member of my family dangerously hanging off a tall ladder trying to hang something.  I obviously was not on board w/ this plan but he was not to be refused.  The painting still hangs there today.

On the last night here, we played Dungeons and Dragons. It was awesome. Wayne DM'd and we played for several hours. He had casually mentioned it for years but as I said, it wasn't something I grew up with and was hard pressed to get involved. That is one hell of a regret - not for the game - but for spending time with my friend doing something he loved so much. After he left, we made plans for him to come back. He wanted to spend more time in the mountains with nature. 

Almost a year to do the day that he left was the heart attack that killed him. 

He wasn't alone when he died and I am glad for that. Wayne was good people, and the world is a duller place for his loss.
